## ElementStateController

ElementStateController and ElementState are two JavaScript classes that provide a convenient and versatile way to manage states. The classes allow you to control a group of items's states.

🔧 Seamlessly Control Element States: With ElementStateController, you can effortlessly make active, inactive, or toggle states of the elements, giving you complete control over their functionality. 💡

🎯 Perfect for Every Use Case: Whether it's managing user settings, controlling UI elements, or implementing dynamic behavior, ElementStateController has got you covered! 🧩

💪 Manage Multiple Elements with Ease: Say goodbye to repetitive tasks! ElementStateController empowers you to handle multiple elements with a single instance.

🎨 Customize to Your Heart's Content: Tailor each element's behavior to requirements with ease.

📦 Simple Installation: Installing ElementStateController is a breeze! Just run a single npm command, and you're ready to go.

### Constructor

```javascript
constructor(elements: Object, options: Object)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| elements | Object | A collection of elements to be managed. Each key represents the element name, and the value can be either an instance of `ElementState` or a plain object representing the element state. |
| options | Object | An optional object that can contain the following properties:<br>`activeAll`: A boolean value to determine whether all elements should be turned on initially.<br>`inactiveAll`: A boolean value to determine whether all elements should be initially inactive.<br>`multiple`: A boolean value to allow turning on multiple elements at once. |

### Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `addElement(name: string, elementState: Object): void` | Adds a new element to the `ElementStateController`. |
| `getElement(name: string): ElementState` | Get an element state|
| `activeAll(): void` | Turns on all elements managed by the `ElementStateController`. |
| `inactiveAll(): void` | Turns off all elements managed by the `ElementStateController`. |
| `active(name: string): void` | Turns on the specified element by its name. |
| `inactive(name: string): void` | Turns off the specified element by its name. |
| `toggle(name: string): void` | Toggles the specified element by its name. |
| `setIsAlwaysActive(name: string, value: boolean): void` | Set isAlwaysActive property on an element specified by the name. |

### Example

```javascript
// Creating a new ElementStateController instance with initial states
const states = {
  state1: new ElementState({ name: 'state1', value: false }),
  state2: { name: 'state2', value: true, isAlwaysActive: true }
};
const options = {
  activeAll: true, // Turn all states are in active initially
  multiple : true // Allow multiple states to be active simultaneously
};
const elementStateController = new ElementStateController(elements, options);

// Turning off a specific element
elementStateController.inactive('state1');

// Toggling the state of a specific element
elementStateController.toggle('state1');

// Adding a new element
elementStateController.addElement('state3', new ElementState({ name: 'state3', value: true }));
```

## ElementState

The `ElementState` class represents an individual element state. It allows you to manage the state and behavior of individual elements.

### Constructor

```javascript
constructor({ name: string, value: boolean, isAlwaysActive?: boolean })
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The name of the element. |
| value | Boolean | The initial value of the element (true for active, false for inactive). |
| isAlwaysActive | Boolean | An optional parameter that determines if the element's state should always be active and cannot be inactive. Default is `false`. |

### Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `active(): void` | Turns on the element. |
| `inactive(): void` | Turns off the element. |
| `toggle(): void` | Toggles the value of the element between active and inactive. |
| `isActive(): void` | Checks if the element state is active or inactive. |
| `isAlwaysActive(): boolean` | Returns a boolean value indicating if the element state is set to always active. |
| `setIsAlwaysActive(value): void` | Sets the state is always active or not. |

### Example

```javascript
// Creating a new ElementState instance
const element1 = new ElementState({ name: 'element1', value: false, isAlwaysActive: true });

// Turning on the element
element1.active();

// Toggling the state of the element
element1.toggle();

// Checking if the element is always active
const alwaysActive = element1.isAlwaysActive(); // Returns true
```
