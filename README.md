## SwitchController

SwitchController and SwitchState are two JavaScript classes that provide a convenient and versatile way to manage switches and their states. The classes allow you to control a group of switches, customize their behavior, and handle user interactions efficiently.

ðŸ”§ Seamlessly Control Switch States: With SwitchController, you can effortlessly turn on, turn off, or toggle switches, giving you complete control over their functionality. ðŸ’¡

ðŸŽ¯ Perfect for Every Use Case: Whether it's managing user settings, controlling UI elements, or implementing dynamic behavior, SwitchController has got you covered! ðŸ§©

ðŸ’ª Manage Multiple Switches with Ease: Say goodbye to repetitive tasks! SwitchController empowers you to handle multiple switches with a single instance.

ðŸŽ¨ Customize to Your Heart's Content: Tailor each switch's behavior to fit your application's specific requirements with ease.

ðŸ“¦ Simple Installation: Installing SwitchController is a breeze! Just run a single npm command, and you're ready to go.

Join thousands of developers who have already embraced SwitchController to simplify their switch management process. Take control of your switches and elevate your application's performance today!

### Constructor

```javascript
constructor(switches: Object, options: Object)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| switches | Object | A collection of switches to be managed. Each key represents the switch name, and the value can be either an instance of `SwitchState` or a plain object representing the switch state. |
| options | Object | An optional object that can contain the following properties:<br>`onAll`: A boolean value to determine whether all switches should be turned on initially.<br>`offAll`: A boolean value to determine whether all switches should be turned off initially.<br>`multiple`: A boolean value to allow turning on all switches at once. |

### Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `addSwitch(name: string, switchState: Object): void` | Adds a new switch to the `SwitchController`. |
| `onAll(): void` | Turns on all switches managed by the `SwitchController`. |
| `offAll(): void` | Turns off all switches managed by the `SwitchController`. |
| `on(name: string): void` | Turns on the specified switch by its name. |
| `off(name: string): void` | Turns off the specified switch by its name. |
| `toggle(name: string): void` | Toggles the specified switch by its name. |

### Example

```javascript
// Creating a new SwitchController instance with initial switches
const switches = {
  switch1: new SwitchState({ name: 'switch1', value: false }),
  switch2: { name: 'switch2', value: true, isAlwaysOn: true }
};
const options = {
  onAll: true // Turn on all switches initially
};
const switchController = new SwitchController(switches, options);

// Turning off a specific switch
switchController.off('switch1');

// Toggling the state of a specific switch
switchController.toggle('switch2');

// Adding a new switch
switchController.addSwitch('switch3', new SwitchState({ name: 'switch3', value: true }));
```

## SwitchState

The `SwitchState` class represents an individual switch state. It allows you to manage the state and behavior of individual switches.

### Constructor

```javascript
constructor({ name: string, value: boolean, isAlwaysOn?: boolean })
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | The name of the switch. |
| value | Boolean | The initial value of the switch (true for on, false for off). |
| isAlwaysOn | Boolean | An optional parameter that determines if the switch should always be on and cannot be turned off. Default is `false`. |

### Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `on(): void` | Turns on the switch. |
| `off(): void` | Turns off the switch. |
| `toggle(): void` | Toggles the value of the switch between on and off. |
| `isAlwaysOn(): boolean` | Returns a boolean value indicating if the switch is always on. |

### Example

```javascript
// Creating a new SwitchState instance
const switch1 = new SwitchState({ name: 'switch1', value: false, isAlwaysOn: true });

// Turning on the switch
switch1.on();

// Toggling the state of the switch
switch1.toggle();

// Checking if the switch is always on
const alwaysOn = switch1.isAlwaysOn(); // Returns true
```
